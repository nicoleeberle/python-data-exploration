# Data Exploration in Python
Here you can see some basic data exploration and visualization using Python. Packages used include pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. 

In this exploration, various files are combined to create one dataset then variables are formatted and new variables are created from original variables. Next, I check for missing values and look at the summary statistics of each variable. Simple histograms and bar charts are created to help gain deeper understanding of the data set and to help remove outliers. Finally, visuals are made using multiple variables to understand relationships between the variables and to answer questions the dataset. 

# Files
The following files are available to download:
1. HTML: Final write up of analysis including all code, visualizations and analysis. This is all you need to see the full project
2. Code: Python code file. This allows you to re-run the analysis on your own
3. Data: The CSV files used to create the dataset. This allows you to re-run the analysis on your own
